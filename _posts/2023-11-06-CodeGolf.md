Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the **shortest possible source code** that solves a certain problem.  

I occasionally take part in a codegolf challenge. Note that, more tips can be found by searching some language's name + "codegolf tip" on Google.  

This will be updated weekly, as soon as I found something new when attending these contests. The format is sorted in decreasing order of the solutions' length, from the naivest one to my best solution.

### Python
#### Check if either string a or string b empty string 
```Python
a==""||b=="" # 12 bytes
min(a,b)=="" # 12 bytes
""in[a,b]    # 9 bytes
```
#### Recursion when a function's name is fixed
```Python
VeryLongFunctionName=lambda a:1 if a<1 else VeryLongFunctionName(a-1)*a # 66 bytes
VeryLongFunctionName=p=lambda a:1 if a<1 else p(a-1)*a                  # 48 bytes
```
Note that, the original function can be shorten as:
```Python
VeryLongFunctionName=lambda a:a<1 or VeryLongFunctionName(a-1)*a
```
